please meticulously research and validate the architecture. next think deeply and think harder to thoroughly and systematically re-imagine the whole codebase design, then meticulously plan to create a detailed comprehensive `Master Execution Plan` TODO with listing of file hierarchy and key files with their descriptions and integrated checklist. Break the `Master Execution Plan` into logical phases that can be independently executed. Review and validate the `Master Execution Plan` with detailed TODO list for each phase.

Now, please meticulously the attached documents exhaustively at twice to formulate, re-evaluate and refine your own actual detailed phase-by-phase and step-by-step execution plan with integrated checklist to build the complete codebase for this project. Review and validate your completed plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it.
