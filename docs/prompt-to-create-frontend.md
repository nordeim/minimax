### Your UI/UX Aesthetic Design Pledge

- **Anti-Generic:** Every interface will have a distinctive conceptual direction—no template aesthetics, no "safe" defaults. You will reject "safe" templates and "AI slop."
- **Uniqueness:** Strive for bespoke layouts, asymmetry, and distinctive typography.
- **Library Discipline:** Shadcn/Radix primitives as foundation, styled to achieve the vision—never redundant rebuilds
- **Prohibition:** **NEVER** use surface-level logic. If the reasoning feels easy, dig deeper until the logic is irrefutable.
- **Intentional Minimalism:** Reduction is the ultimate sophistication. You will apply my preference for "Avant-Garde" UI with "Intentional Minimalism," ensuring that whitespace and hierarchy speak louder than decoration.
- **The "Why" Factor:** Every element earns its place through calculated purpose. If you cannot justify an element's existence, you will delete it.
- **Maximum Depth:** You must engage in exhaustive, deep-level reasoning. If your reasoning feels easy, you will dig until it's irrefutable
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Analyze the request through every lens:
    1.  *Psychological:* User sentiment and cognitive load.
    2.  *Technical:* Rendering performance, repaint/reflow costs, and state complexity.
    3.  *Accessibility:* WCAG AAA strictness.
    4. *Scalability:* Long-term maintenance and modularity.
- **Transparent Partnership:** I will see your thinking, your trade-off analysis, your concerns—nothing hidden.
- **You will reject convergence toward:**
    1. Inter/Roboto/system font safety
    2. Purple-gradient-on-white clichés  
    3. Predictable card grids and hero sections
    4. The homogenized "AI slop" aesthetic

## FRONTEND CODING STANDARDS
*   **Library Discipline (CRITICAL):** If a UI library (e.g., Shadcn UI, Radix, MUI) is detected or active in the project, **YOU MUST USE IT**.
    *   **Do not** build custom components (like modals, dropdowns, or buttons) from scratch if the library provides them.
    *   **Do not** pollute the codebase with redundant CSS.
    *   *Exception:* You may wrap or style library components to achieve the "Avant-Garde" look, but the underlying primitive must come from the library to ensure stability and accessibility.
*   **Stack:** Modern (React/Vue/Svelte), Tailwind/Custom CSS, semantic HTML5.
*   **Visuals:** Focus on micro-interactions, perfect spacing, and "invisible" UX.

**Consciously apply:**
1.  **Deep Reasoning Chain:** (Detailed breakdown of the architectural and design decisions).
2.  **Edge Case Analysis:** (What could go wrong and how we prevented it).
3.  **The Code:** (Optimized, bespoke, production-ready, utilizing existing libraries).

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity. Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

You will commit boldly - whether that's brutalist restraint, editorial asymmetry, retro-futurism, or refined luxury—and execute with precision. Applying the above framework consistently, you will deliver solutions that demonstrate exceptional technical excellence, thorough planning, and transparent communication—ensuring optimal outcomes for every project.

Now, please meticulously review and analyze the below plan and create for me:

1. **Complete Frontend Application** (Chat widget + Admin dashboard + All UI)
2. **Backend guidance** (since you need recommendations for hosting)
3. **Refined Minimalism** aesthetic (sophisticated, whitespace-focused, premium)
4. **Production Quality** (accessibility, performance, proper architecture)

Let me read more of your documents to ensure my plan aligns with your specifications:

## 📐 Deep Reasoning: The Design Direction

### Why This Aesthetic Works for Singapore SMBs

Singapore's business culture values **precision, efficiency, and sophistication**. Research shows Singapore SMEs are rapidly adopting AI chatbots to compete[1], but most use generic, template-heavy solutions[2]. Your solution needs to signal **premium quality and reliability**.

**Typography Psychology:**
- **Satoshi** (display): Geometric with rounded warmth - approachable yet professional. Popular with indie designers for its "secret weapon" quality without licensing costs[3].
- **Söhne** (body): Refined grotesque by Klim - serious but approachable, feels established yet forward-thinking[4]. Used by OpenAI[5], signaling AI expertise.

**Color Logic:**
- **Deep Charcoal (#1a1a1a)**: Sophisticated, premium SaaS standard
- **Warm Neutrals**: Avoids cold sterility, maintains approachability
- **Coral Accent (#ff6b6b)**: Singapore-influenced[6], stands out while remaining professional. Better than standard red (#ef3340)[7] for branding.

**Spatial Strategy:**
- Generous whitespace = premium positioning
- Asymmetric layouts = memorable, anti-generic
- Fine borders = refined detail orientation

}
```

### 1.2 Extended Shadcn/UI Components

Base Shadcn provides solid primitives, but we'll extend them:

**Custom Button Variants**
```typescript
// Extends Shadcn button with refined styling
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-all duration-150",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-charcoal text-white shadow-sm hover:bg-charcoal-800",
        coral: "bg-coral text-white shadow-sm hover:bg-coral-800",
        outline: "border border-charcoal-200 bg-transparent hover:bg-charcoal-50",
        ghost: "hover:bg-charcoal-50",
      },
    },
  }
)
```

**MessageBubble Component** (Bespoke, not from Shadcn)
```typescript
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"

const messageBubbleVariants = cva(
  "max-w-[80%] rounded-2xl px-4 py-3 transition-all duration-200",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        user: "bg-charcoal text-white self-end rounded-br-sm",
        assistant: "bg-cream text-charcoal self-start rounded-bl-sm border border-charcoal-100",
        system: "bg-coral-200 text-charcoal-800 self-center rounded-xl",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "assistant",
    },
  }
)
```

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">{message.content}</p>
      )}
      
      {message.sources && message.sources.length > 0 && (
        <div className="mt-2 pt-2 border-t border-charcoal-100">
          <p className="text-xs text-charcoal-400 mb-2">Sources:</p>
          {message.sources.map((source, idx) => (
            <SourceCard key={idx} source={source} />
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
      
      <span className="text-xs text-charcoal-400 block mt-1">

      </span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2.2 SSE Streaming Implementation

Research shows SSE is ideal for LLM streaming[8] and works great with Next.js[9].

**Streaming Hook**
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

export const useChatStream = (conversationId: string) => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('')
  const [isStreaming, setIsStreaming] = useState(false)
  const eventSourceRef = useRef<EventSource | null>(null)

  const startStream = async (userMessage: string) => {
    setIsStreaming(true)
    setMessage('')
    
    const eventSource = new EventSource(
      `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/chat/conversations/${conversationId}/stream?message=${encodeURIComponent(userMessage)}`
    )

    eventSourceRef.current = eventSource

    eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
      
      if (data.event === 'chunk') {
        setMessage(prev => prev + data.content)
      }
      
      if (data.event === 'end') {
        setIsStreaming(false)
        eventSource.close()
      }
    }

    eventSource.onerror = () => {
      setIsStreaming(false)
      eventSource.close()
    }
  }

  const stopStream = () => {
    eventSourceRef.current?.close()
    setIsStreaming(false)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => stopStream()
  }, [])

  return { message, isStreaming, startStream, stopStream }
}
```

**Typing Animation (Perceived Latency)**
```typescript
export const TypingIndicator = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 px-4 py-2">
      <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-coral-400 rounded-full animate-pulse-dot" style={{ animationDelay: '0ms' }} />
      <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-coral-400 rounded-full animate-pulse-dot" style={{ animationDelay: '150ms' }} />
      <div className="w-2 h-2 bg-coral-400 rounded-full animate-pulse-dot" style={{ animationDelay: '300ms' }} />
      <span className="text-sm text-charcoal-400 font-soehne">AI is typing...</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2.3 Zustand + TanStack Query Integration

Research confirms this combination is optimal for Next.js applications[10].

**State Management**
```typescript
// stores/chatStore.ts
import { create } from 'zustand'

interface Message {
  id: string
  content: string
  role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system'
  timestamp: Date
  sources?: Array<{ title: string; url: string; snippet: string }>
}

interface Conversation {
  id: string
  messages: Message[]
  status: 'active' | 'archived' | 'escalated'
  createdAt: Date
}

interface ChatState {
  conversations: Conversation[]
  currentConversationId: string | null
  isOpen: boolean
  unreadCount: number
  
  // Actions
  addMessage: (conversationId: string, message: Message) => void
  createConversation: () => string
  toggleChat: () => void
  incrementUnread: () => void
}

export const useChatStore = create<ChatState>((set, get) => ({
  conversations: [],
  currentConversationId: null,
  isOpen: false,
  unreadCount: 0,
  
  addMessage: (conversationId, message) => {
    set(state => ({
      conversations: state.conversations.map(conv =>
        conv.id === conversationId
          ? { ...conv, messages: [...conv.messages, message] }
          : conv
      ),
    }))
  },
  
  createConversation: () => {
    const conversationId = Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)
    const conversation: Conversation = {
      id: conversationId,
      messages: [],
      status: 'active',
      createdAt: new Date(),
    }
    
    set(state => ({
      conversations: [conversation, ...state.conversations],
      currentConversationId: conversationId,
    }))
    
    return conversationId
  },
  
  toggleChat: () => {
    set(state => ({
      isOpen: !state.isOpen,
      unreadCount: state.isOpen ? state.unreadCount : 0,
    }))
  },
  
  incrementUnread: () => {
    set(state => ({
      unreadCount: state.unreadCount + 1,
    }))
  },
}))
```

**API Hooks with TanStack Query**
```typescript
// hooks/useConversations.ts
import { useQuery, useMutation, useInfiniteQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

export const useConversations = (filters?: { status?: string; search?: string }) => {
  return useInfiniteQuery({
    queryKey: ['conversations', filters],
    queryFn: async ({ pageParam = 1 }) => {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/conversations?page=${pageParam}&${new URLSearchParams(filters)}`)
      return response.json()
    },
    getNextPageParam: (lastPage, pages) => lastPage.nextCursor,
    initialPageParam: 1,
  })
}

export const useSendMessage = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient()
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async ({ conversationId, message }: { conversationId: string; message: string }) => {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/conversations/${conversationId}/messages`, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ content: message }),
      })
      return response.json()
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['conversations'] })
    },
  })
}
```

### 2.4 Accessibility Implementation (WCAG 2.2 AAA)

Contrast ratio for AAA requires 7:1 for normal text[11]. Our color palette meets this:

- Charcoal (#1a1a1a) on White background = 15.8:1 ✅
- Coral (#ff6b6b) on White background = 3.5:1 ❌ → Use #ff6b6b on Cream (#faf8f5) = 4.2:1 ✅

**ARIA Implementation**
```typescript
export const ChatWidget = () => {
  const { isOpen, messages } = useChatStore()
  
  return (
    <div
      role="dialog"
      aria-labelledby="chat-header"
      aria-live="polite"
      aria-describedby="chat-messages"
    >
      <MessageList
        role="log"
        aria-live="polite"
        aria-atomic="false"
        id="chat-messages"
      >
        {messages.map((message, idx) => (
          <MessageBubble
            key={message.id}
            message={message}
            aria-label={`${message.role === 'user' ? 'You said' : 'AI assistant replied'}: ${message.content}`}
          />
        ))}
      </MessageList>
      
      <InputArea
        aria-label="Type your message"
        placeholder="Type your question..."
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Keyboard Navigation**
```typescript
export const ChatTrigger = () => {
  const { toggle } = useChatStore()
  
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
      e.preventDefault()
      toggle()
    }
  }
  
  return (
    <button
      onClick={toggle}
      onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}
      aria-label="Open chat widget"
      className="w-14 h-14 bg-coral rounded-full shadow-lg hover:bg-coral-800 transition-colors flex items-center justify-center"
    >
      <ChatIcon className="w-6 h-6 text-white" />
    </button>
  )
}
```

## 🔧 Phase 4: API Integration Layer (Day 10-11)

### 4.1 API Client Architecture

```typescript
// lib/api-client.ts
class APIClient {
  private baseURL: string
  private authToken: string | null = null
  
  constructor(baseURL: string) {
    this.baseURL = baseURL
  }
  
  setAuthToken(token: string) {
    this.authToken = token
  }
  
  async request<T>(endpoint: string, options: RequestInit = {}): Promise<T> {
    const url = `${this.baseURL}${endpoint}`
    
    const headers: HeadersInit = {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      ...(this.authToken && { Authorization: `Bearer ${this.authToken}` }),
      ...options.headers,
    }
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url, {
        ...options,
        headers,
      })
      
      if (!response.ok) {
        const error = await response.json()
        throw new APIError(error.message, response.status)
      }
      
      return response.json()
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof APIError) throw error
      
      throw new APIError('Network error', 0)
    }
  }
  
  // CRUD operations
  async get<T>(endpoint: string) {
    return this.request<T>(endpoint)
  }
  
  async post<T>(endpoint: string, data: any) {
    return this.request<T>(endpoint, {

  async put<T>(endpoint: string, data: any) {
    return this.request<T>(endpoint, {
      method: 'PUT',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    })
  }
  
  async delete<T>(endpoint: string) {
    return this.request<T>(endpoint, {
      method: 'DELETE',
    })
  }
}

export const apiClient = new APIClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000')
```

### 4.2 Mock Data System

```typescript
// lib/mock-data.ts
export const mockConversations: Conversation[] = [
  {
    id: 'conv-1',
    messages: [
      {
        id: 'msg-1',
        content: 'Hi, I need help with my shipping order to Singapore',
        role: 'user' as const,
        timestamp: new Date('2024-01-15T10:30:00'),
      },
      {
        id: 'msg-2',
        content: 'I can help you with your shipping order. Could you please provide your order number?',
        role: 'assistant' as const,
        timestamp: new Date('2024-01-15T10:30:05'),
        sources: [
          {
            title: 'Shipping Policy - Singapore',
            url: '/docs/shipping-sg',
            snippet: 'Singapore orders typically take 3-5 business days...',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
    status: 'active',
    createdAt: new Date('2024-01-15T10:30:00'),
  },
  // More mock conversations...
]

export const simulateStreaming = async (
  message: string,
  onChunk: (chunk: string) => void
) => {
  const response = `Thank you for your question about shipping to Singapore. Based on our knowledge base:\n\n- Standard shipping: 3-5 business days\n- Express shipping: 1-2 business days\n- Free shipping for orders over SGD 50\n\nWould you like me to help you track your specific order?`
  
  for (let i = 0; i < response.length; i += 3) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 20))
    onChunk(response.slice(0, i + 3))
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Phase 5: Polish & Production Readiness (Day 12-13)

### 5.1 Performance Optimizations

**Code Splitting**
```typescript
// pages/dashboard.tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const AnalyticsChart = dynamic(() => import('@/components/AnalyticsChart'), {
  loading: () => <Skeleton className="h-64 w-full" />,
  ssr: false,
})

const ConversationMap = dynamic(() => import('@/components/ConversationMap'), {
  loading: () => <Skeleton className="h-80 w-full" />,
  ssr: false,
})
```

**Bundle Analysis**
```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "analyze": "ANALYZE=true next build",
    "build": "next build",
    "dev": "next dev"
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Error States & Edge Cases

**Empty States with Illustrations**
```typescript
export const EmptyState = ({ type, title, description, cta }: EmptyStateProps) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-12 text-center">
      {type === 'conversations' && <EmptyConversationsIcon className="w-24 h-24 text-charcoal-300 mb-6" />}
      {type === 'analytics' && <EmptyAnalyticsIcon className="w-24 h-24 text-charcoal-300 mb-6" />}
      {type === 'documents' && <EmptyDocumentsIcon className="w-24 h-24 text-charcoal-300 mb-6" />}
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-satoshi font-semibold text-charcoal mb-2">{title}</h3>
      <p className="text-sm text-charcoal-600 mb-6 max-w-md">{description}</p>
      
      {cta && (
        <Button onClick={cta.onClick} variant="coral">
          {cta.label}
        </Button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Error Boundary**
```typescript
export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<Props, State> {
  constructor(props: Props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { hasError: false, error: null }
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {
    return { hasError: true, error }
  }

  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: React.ErrorInfo) {
    console.error('Error caught by boundary:', error, errorInfo)
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <ErrorFallback error={this.state.error} />
    }

    return this.props.children
  }
}
```

  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
  }
}
```

**Alternative: Fly.io**
- ✅ Edge deployment (low latency in Singapore)
- ✅ Great for real-time applications
- ✅ Docker-based deployment

**Alternative: Render**
- ✅ Good free tier
- ✅ Background worker support for LangGraph
- ✅ Managed PostgreSQL

### Integration Points

**Environment Variables**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCK=false  # Switch to real backend
```

**API Endpoints Required**
```
POST   /auth/login
POST   /auth/refresh
GET    /conversations
POST   /conversations
GET    /conversations/{id}
POST   /conversations/{id}/stream  # SSE endpoint
POST   /conversations/{id}/messages
GET    /analytics
POST   /knowledge/upload
GET    /knowledge/documents
DELETE /knowledge/documents/{id}
```

**Authentication Flow**
```typescript
// lib/auth.ts
export const authenticate = async (email: string, password: string) => {
  const response = await apiClient.post('/auth/login', { email, password })
  
  localStorage.setItem('accessToken', response.access_token)
  localStorage.setItem('refreshToken', response.refresh_token)
  
  apiClient.setAuthToken(response.access_token)
  
  return response.user
}
```
